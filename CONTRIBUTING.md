# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Repositories
This project is primarily maintained on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/infograb-public/J2Lab). A mirror of the repository is also available on GitHub for wider visibility.

## Issue
There are 4 types of issues (each with their own corresponding label):
- feature: These track specific feature requests and ideas until they are complete. They can evolve from a proposal or can be submitted individually depending on the size.
- bug: These track bugs with the code
- docs: These track problems with the documentation (i.e. missing or incomplete)
- refactor: These track refactoring without changing the functionality of the code

## Merge Request
Just like many successful open-source projects, we use Merge Requests (MRs) to track and manage changes to the codebase. Below is the workflow to submit and review an MR.
### MR Lifecycle

1. MR Creation
   - MRs are commonly created to resolve a specific issue, but they can also be standalone. 
   - MRs that are works-in-progress should have titles prefixed with "WIP: [title]". Once the MR is ready for review, remove the "WIP" prefix.

2. Assigning Reviews

   - After submission, the maintainer responsible for triaging will assign appropriate labels and milestones.
   - The maintainer will self-request a review or assign another maintainer to review the MR.

3. Reviewing and Discussion

   - Use GitLab's review tools to perform code reviews.
   - A comment should be made for questions about the code that don't necessitate changes.
   - Labels should be updated as needed (e.g., `status::reviewing` ).

4. Merge or Close

   - MRs should remain open until they are merged or if they have been inactive for over 30 days.
   - Before merging an MR, please ensure it has the required number of approvals.
   - If the owner of the MR is listed in the OWNERS file, that individual must merge their own MRs or explicitly request another OWNER to do so.
